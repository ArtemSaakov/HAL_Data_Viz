# *HAL Data Visualization Project*

This project utilizes steamlit

The program is meant to visualize data from the Historical American Lynching Data Collection Project.
Data can be filtered by various attributes, which the streamlit sidebar will show prompts for.
The porject is incomplete when it comes to visualizing data, and has the potential to implement
Census data, likely by connecting the counties in the HAL data to the counties in the Census data.

Currently, the streamlit app launches, but proper data visualization is not yet implemented.
